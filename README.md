# What am I working on now?
Many of the repositories and related files are outdated as I haven't been pushing regularly, but I plan to update them over the next six months. Currently I'm working on development
of a multi-functional platform through an API that will be hosted on Heroku/Render. This will be done through a mix of Python, FastAPI, SQL, Javascript, and related technologies. 

Some other projects/interests I've started but haven't delved too deeply in:
  - Mobile Development for iOS in Swift (Only basic code at the moment, currently working on API calls)
  - Cross Platform Private Chat using End-to-End Encryption (Currently working on hosting) 
  - Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Binary Classification, Computer Vision, Decision Trees, Pruning, Mathematics)
  - Hold'Em Poker Simulator (To feature modeling against GTO (Game-Theory Optimal) play, Random Sampling, Edge Simulatons. These features will likely never be open source, and I've only currently implemented basic object oriented code.)
  - Databases -> RDBMS design, JDBC, OracleSQL, full design + implementation. This has now evolved into its own full fledged I/O project, which is one of my featured repositories. Eventually, I want my project to be able to handle things like VectorDB, Time Series DB, and many other features that serve as the backbone behind data integrity today.   

Looking forward to completing many of these projects by the end of the year! 

# Important Note
A lot of the time, my repositories are extremely out of date compared to the actual progress of the project because I don't push all of the features and code to Github, particuarly due to my distate of how private codebases are used as training data to put developers out of jobs. That isn't to say my code is anywhere near good enough to be even used as training data, but Microsoft recently forced out the CEO of Github, likely because he was against the integration of private codebases into MS Copilot. AI has undoubtedly been helpful for my own personal development and growth as a programmer, but I can't say I agree with their methods to train the models. Eventually, I hope that regulations are enforced to solve issues like these, or alternative software to host software is developed.
